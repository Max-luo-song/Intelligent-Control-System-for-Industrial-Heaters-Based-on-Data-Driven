# Intelligent-Control-System-for-Industrial-Heaters-Based-on-Data-Driven
This project is a software module of an intelligent control system for industrial heaters based on data driven technology, which can perform intelligent temperature control

# Program Description
The overall QT project uses the qmake compiler \

Software environment: windows10+Qt5.12+Qt creator \

The /src file contains all the codes for this project \

# Function Description
This project is a software module for a data-driven industrial heater intelligent control system. The software terminal transmits instructions to a lower industrial computer through a serial port, supporting three heating modes: manual mode, normal mode, and automatic mode. This project can be deployed with the Loongson development board
